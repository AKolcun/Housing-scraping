# Housing-scraping
Automated script for finding and filtering temp housing

Through repeated use, I found the UI for furnishedfinder.com was lacking in filtering options
and required much more time searching through records that were poor matches for my needs.
This script pulls records from the FF site, then cleans and filters the records.
The resulting data is then ported into Google DataStudio for easier review.

*NOTE* Since initial development, FF has begun using CloudFlare to impede scraping.
The script is now non-functional.
